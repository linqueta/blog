Hey, my name is Lincoln. I'm a software engineer in Brazil, where I work more on backend side than anothers sides. In general, I'm working with many languages and tecnologies, but I love (truthy) Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I even have a certificate of this.

With this stack, I have many work years, with many projects and companies. For more informations about companies, tecnologies and certificates, see in my Linkedin.

Also check my github, I write many public projects.
