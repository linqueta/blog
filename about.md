Hey, my name is Lincoln and I'm a software engineer in Brazil. In the last years, I've worked more with backend than apps and fronted, however, I know and have experience with many programming languages and frameworks, but, I like very much Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

For more pieces of information about me, about my experiences, technologies, and certifications, you may check my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-rodrigues-268187103). I've written many things in my [Github](https://github.com/linqueta), check it too.
