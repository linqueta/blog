Hey, my name is Lincoln. I'm a software engineer in Brazil, where I work more on backend side than anothers sides. In general, I'm working with many languages and tecnologies, but I love (truthy) Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I even have a certificate of this.

With this stack, I have many work years, in many projects and companies. For more informations about companies, tecnologies and certificates, see in my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lincoln-rodrigues-268187103).

Also check my [Github](https://github.com/linqueta), I have wrote many public projects.
