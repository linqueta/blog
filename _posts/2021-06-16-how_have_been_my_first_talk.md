Yeah, I reached a goal in my career that was to have an experience talking to other devs about a topic that I know as very well. The topic was about to use UUID on Ruby on Rails using Postgresql and another kind of relational databases that ActiveRecord supports.

On the start, I was a little anxious but during the talk, I had been calmer. The talk with the participants was easy because all participated in the whole time of the talk. On the end, I did some live code implementing UUID on Ruby on Rails application using Postgresql. Almost all was ok because some details in a migration broken when I ran `rails db:migrate`, but I had the same project working, then, I showed the result in this project.

The talk was at [Petlove](https://petlove.com) (where I work in the current moment) in your first TechTalk join with another talk about tests for Frontend applications.
