A few months later that I've launched this blog I got my second talk in an important IT group in São Paulo and it shows me that I'm on the right way in my career.
I participated in the last [GuruSP meeting edition](https://www.meetup.com/Guru-SP-Grupo-de-Usuarios-Ruby-de-Sao-Paulo/events/261823985/) at [Pitzi](https://pitzi.com.br/) office.

My talk was the last talk in this event (before the beer :D) and I talked about how to use UUID in a Rails application and why we should consider using UUID in our projects, like my first talk that I said about in this [post](https://linqueta.com/rails/uuid/active_record/talk/2019/06/16/how_have_been_my_first_talk/). The event also has other amazing talks:

* Refatoração: um pouco além do código by Edmilton
* Orientação a Objetos - O que normalmente não se fala by Rinaldi
* O efeito das comunidades na programação: a transformação de vidas by Jéssica
* Decodificando o code review by Elaine
* Rails + ReactJS, Ambicious Web Applications by Renato
* De Mongo, Rails 3 e VPS para Postgres, Rails 5 e Heroku: Uma história de migração by PotHix

Among the talks, the Pitzi staff feed us with some finger foods (amazing finger foods) and four options of beer (this part was so amazing, I've enjoyed a lot :D). After the talks, we had a moment to know other people there, making network with some devs, heads, uxs and other kind of IT jobs.

I hope that my next talk happens soon.
